I'm a hacker and entrepreneur. I have been generalizing complex problems and developing various frameworks and middleware to solve them. I can not only develop cutting edge technologies, but also use these technologies to develop products that solve real world problems.

## Professional experience

### Datachain(2018-): Co-founder, CTO, Blockchain engineer

- Lead research and development in blockchain interoperability
- Design and development in PoC with partner companies
- See the project details "Media" section.

The following is a representative list of projects:

- [Hyperledger YUI](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/?q=yui-): DLT/Blockchain interoperability framework (Especially, I developed Ethereum, Fabric, and IBC Relayer)
- [Cross Framework](https://github.com/datachainlab/cross): A framework empowers the development of smart contracts that support cross-chain transactions.
- [Hypermint](https://github.com/datachainlab/hypermint): Blockchain supports WASM-based smart contract
- Plasma chain(Ethereum L2 scaling solution): Solidity, Golang, Tendermint

### Freelance

Developed backend systems in adtech domain. Mainly designed and developed the backend of systems that can handle high traffic.

- A high-traffic ad server(over 100,000rps): Golang, Aerospike, AWS, Jenkins, Ansible, etc.
- Developed a batch system that transfers large ad tracking logs: Golang, Fluentd, [go-flow](https://github.com/bluele/go-flow)

### Momentum(2014-2017): Co-founder, CTO

Developed the Ad verification service to protect advertisers from reputation risks when serving ads, and introduced it to DSP and Ad networks.

- Ad verfication service(Brand safety, Ad fraud protection): Go, JavaScript, Python, AWS, GCP(BigQuery)
- Developed a batch system that enables crawling tens of millions of URLs per hour.
- Implemented a classifier for categorizing web pages in cooperation with a laboratory at Tokyo Institute of Technology.
- [Acquired by KDDI group company](https://jp.techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/syndot-momentum/)

### JustSystems(2013): Software engineer

- Researched and developed an application of similar image retrieval as an experimental project for new graduates: Python, OpenCV, Apache Solr
- Developed a backend system for social commerce service: Java, Scala, Play Framework, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS, etc.

## OSS (Only as founder)

The following lists are only as founder. Other contributions can be checked in my github account: https://github.com/bluele

- [Cross Framework](https://github.com/datachainlab/cross): A framework that enables the development of smart contracts that support Cross-chain transaction.
- [gcache](https://github.com/bluele/gcache): In-memory cache library supports many eviction policies. Used by [many companies and projects](https://github.com/search?l=&o=desc&q=github.com%2Fbluele%2Fgcache+language%3AGo&s=indexed&type=Code).
- [hypermint](https://github.com/datachainlab/hypermint): Blockchain supports WASM-based smart contract
- [redis-semaphore](https://github.com/bluele/redis-semaphore): A distributed semaphore and mutex built on Redis. 
- [factory-go](https://github.com/bluele/factory-go): A library for setting up Golang objects.
- [Many other projects](https://github.com/bluele?tab=repositories)
